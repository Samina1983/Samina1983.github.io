        K2 (8,611m / 28,251ft) is the world’s second highest mountain, after Everest (8,848.9m), and has traditionally been considered the most difficult of the world’s 14 8,000-meter peaks. It has been referred to as The Savage Mountain since 1953, when American climber and physicist George Bell, who’d nearly perished in a six-man fall on the mountain, told reporters, “It’s a savage mountain that tries to kill you.”
